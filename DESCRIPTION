Authors@R: person("Lauren", "O'Brien", email = "obrlsoilau@gmail.com", role = c('aut', 'cre'))
Description: This package uses 'V8' (https://github.com/jeroen/v8) to access the javascript bindings for Uber's H3 library (https://github.com/uber/h3-js). It is intended as a temporary solution until direct R bindings are written for H3 itself (https://github.com/uber/h3).
